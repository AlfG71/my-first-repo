# Learning Git

Important steps for Git workflow:

1. Initialize repository with git init
2. Create changes to project files
3. Check status of those files with git status
4. Stage changes for commit
5. Commit changes to version history
6. View previous changes with git log

Sometimes the code in your remote repository will contain commits you do not have in your local repository. In those situations, you will need to pull the commits from the remote repository into your local repository. There are four basic scenarios when you will run into this:

  1. You work on a team, and multiple people pushed code to the remote repository.
  2. You pushed to the remote repository from a different machine.
  3. Your project is public on GitHub and somebody contributed to it.
  4. You made a change to a file directly on GitHub.com.
